  {
    "name": "HelicalGear",
    "description": "Helical gears are one type of cylindrical gears with slanted tooth trace. Compared to spur gears, they have the larger contact ratio and excel in quietness and less vibration and able to transmit large force. A pair of helical gears has the same helix angle but the helix hand is opposite."
  },
  {
    "name": "HerringboneGear",
    "description": "Like helical gears, they have the advantage of transferring power smoothly, because more than two teeth will be enmeshed at any moment in time. Their advantage over the helical gears is that the side-Rmust of one half is balanced by that of the other half. This means that herringbone gears can be used in torque gearboxes without requiring a substantial thrust bearing. Because of this, herringbone gears were an important step in the introduction of the steam turbine to marine propulsion."

    "description": "Planetary gear systems are widely used in technological systems, such as helicopters, cars, spacecraft, mining machineries, and so on, which have the advantages of compact structures, high transmission efficiency, and large transmission ratio. The load can be evenly distributed on planet gears to achieve the purpose of torque shunting. The normal operations of planetary gear systems are quite important for the safety and economy of technological systems. Hence, it is imperative to develop reliability models of planetary gear systems based on their practical working mechanism, environmental loads, and material properties."
