# Text Demos

This folder contains command scripts in plain text format (.txt). 
Each line represents a command to be executed by the application.
These can be loaded via the `/load` command or via drag-and-drop to automate design tasks or execute macros.

## Format
*   One command per line.
*   Lines starting with `#` or `//` are treated as comments.
*   Empty lines are ignored.

## Example
```text
/view iso
/parametric box 10 10 10
/move 0 5 0
```
