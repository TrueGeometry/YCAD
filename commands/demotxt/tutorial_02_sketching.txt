# Tutorial 02: Sketching
# Learn how to draw 2D profiles on planes.
# Useful for: Custom cross-sections, floor plans, and complex extrusion profiles.

# 1. Select a Plane
# You can sketch on XY (Front), XZ (Top), or YZ (Right).
/sketch_on XZ

# 2. Draw Basic Shapes
# Rectangle: /sketch_draw rect [width] [height]
/sketch_draw rect 10 6
/tag_last MyBase

# Circle: /sketch_draw circle [radius]
/sketch_draw circle 1.5
# Shapes are drawn at (0,0) of the plane. Move them locally.
/move 3 0 0 

# 3. Draw Parametric Equation
# Example: A sine wave curve
# Syntax: /sketch_draw equation x(t) y(t) min max
/sketch_draw equation t 2*sin(t) -5 5
/move 0 5 0

# 4. Composite Profile (Advanced)
# JSON format for custom point lists
/sketch_draw composite [{"type":"line","x":-8,"y":-8},{"type":"line","x":-6,"y":-8},{"type":"line","x":-7,"y":-6},{"type":"line","x":-8,"y":-8}]

# 5. Finish

# These sketches are now ready for Extrusion!
